\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:08}
The project did not reach its final goal: Implementing Assertion Based Verification.\newline
However, other goals were reached. SteelBrew communicates with Verilator and using the Makefile, rather efficiently. The basic manipulation methods works as expected making the project employable as of this moment. The project further translates the tests in a way that makes parallel execution doable. The concurrency works as expected, and if more tests are added to the batches, this is a tool that can verify multiple DUTs in multiple setups simultaneously.
