\section{Design}\label{sec:04}
The design of SteelBrew will take an Agile approach to get going with some framework for writing and running simple tests on devices written in SystemVerilog, using Java.
\subsection{Usecases}
Using SteelBrew should be as simple as possible. \cref{fig:usecases} shows an overview of the usecases for a developer.

\end{figure}
This is a simplification. As mentioned the framework is executed in Java, so to get started the user would start by creating a java project and importing SteelBrew. Hereafter the DUT is added and tests are defined and configured. A command should then execute the test and start the simulation.
