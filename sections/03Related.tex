In today's landscape a myriad of verification tools exists. Projects like Chisel\footnote{On GitHub: \href{https://github.com/chipsalliance/chisel}{github.com/chipsalliance/chisel}}, and it's forked project SpinalHDL\footnote{On GitHub: \href{https://github.com/SpinalHDL/SpinalHDL}{github.com/SpinalHDL/SpinalHDL}} discards the traditional hardware description languages and testbenches altogether and implements their own, and pyuvm\footnote{On GitHub: \href{https://github.com/pyuvm/pyuvm}{github.com/pyuvm/pyuvm}} takes UVM into python using cocotb\footnote{cocotb on the web: \href{https://www.cocotb.org/}{www.cocotb.org/}} as a backend driver. These tools do however have some problems. Chisel and SpinalHDL requires developers to learn a new description language, which means the communities of developers are small, increasing slowly. pyuvm uses Python which itself is an interpreted language, meaning its runtime resource requirements do not scale well on large projects.
As mentioned earlier ABV is increasingly becoming interesting as performance on verification of complex systems outperforms UVM\cite{reddy_formal_2024}
