	shorttitle = {Formal Verification with {ABV}},
	abstract = {This article explores the evolution and effectiveness of formal verification enhanced with Assertion-Based Verification ({ABV}) as a superior alternative to traditional Universal Verification Methodology ({UVM}) in complex computing chip design. Through analysis of implementation data from major semiconductor companies, including Intel's Core i7 and {IBM}'s {POWER} processors, the article demonstrates how formal methods achieve up to 100\% coverage of critical modules compared to {UVM}'s typical 80-85\% coverage. The research presents quantitative evidence of formal verification's advantages, including a 25-30\% reduction in verification cycles, a 40\% increase in security vulnerability detection, and a 55\% reduction in overall verification time through advanced techniques such as compositional verification and proof decomposition. The article also addresses scalability challenges and resource optimization strategies, providing a comprehensive framework for implementing formal verification in modern chip design workflows.},

This standard includes support for modeling hardware at the behavioral, register transfer level ({RTL}), and gate-level abstraction levels, and for writing test benches using coverage, assertions, object-oriented programming, and constrained random verification. The standard also provides application programming interfaces ({APIs}) to foreign programming languages.
